<p>Drag the sliders to select notes in order. Press play next to a play area to hear that section. (Note: if a slider is on two color boxes, only the higher one will be played. If the slider is on no boxes, it will be a quarter note rest.)</p>
<p>For two players: One player should press "Show", arrange notes on the bottom section, press
"Hide", and then press "Play" next to the covered section to play the piece. Player 1 then
must attempt to recreate the hidden section on the upper sliders. Pressing play on the top section will compare it to the lower section and display a score afterwards.</p>
